Please note: This version has breaking changes.
If you update from a previous version, you will need to adjust your configuration.yaml!

List of changes:
- Major code overhaul for full HA integration. It now runs as a worker process inside HA, instead of calling it as a script in a separate subprocess.
- Introduced coordinator, so data handling is now fully managed and controlled by HA.
- Renamed configuration.yaml to vent_conf.yaml, to avoid confusion with file names.
- Renamed ventcontrol.py to vent_functions.py. (The old script will still work stand-alone)
- Internally not using state and unit_of_measurement anymore, but their native_* counterparts.
- Better log control - supporting log levels error, info and debug now.
