EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES!!!!


This directory contains various Lovelace cards for the ventilation.

## Remote control card

In [remote_control.yaml](./remote_control.yaml) you can find a simulated remote control. I have successfully tested it in a 1/4 screen column of a `sections`dashboard both on my PC (WQHD) and on my mobile phone.

To install it, you will need to create a new manual / user-defined card on your dashboard and paste the YAML into it. Both cardmod and the custom:button-card are requirements for it.
