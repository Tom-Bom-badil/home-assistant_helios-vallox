EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES!!!!


This directory contains various Lovelace cards for the ventilation. Some are still under developemnt.

## Remote control

In [remote_control.yaml](./remote_control.yaml) you can find a simulated remote control. All buttons are fully functional.

The card has been tested both in a 1/4 screen column of a `sections`dashboard both on a PC (WQHD) and on the cell phone (HA companion app).

To install it, you will need to create a new manual / user-defined card on your dashboard and paste the YAML into it. Both cardmod and the custom:button-card are requirements for it.

## Fanspeed control (work in progress!!!)

## Air exchange gauge

[This gauge](gauge_air_exchange.yaml) displays the current air exchange. It requires the optional features in `user_conf.yaml` to be enabled and filled out properly. Also, you might need to adjust the yaml to you individual device.
